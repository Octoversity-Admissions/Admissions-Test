## Course motivation

Steve Jobs once said, "Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer... because it teaches you how to think."

Computer programming is an enormously flexible tool that you can use to do amazing things that are otherwise either manual and laborsome or are just impossible. If you're using a smartphone, a chat app or if you're unlocking your car with the push of a button, then you must know that all these things are using some kind of programming. You're already immersed in the programs of different types. In fact, software is running your life. What if you learn and start running these programs according to your will?

## What's this class about?

## Educational Goals

- Implements algorithms in Python code
- Master Python capabilities, including network protocols, data structures, file permisions, etc
- Design object oriented Python programs
- Build real world Python applications, developing an OSS final project.
